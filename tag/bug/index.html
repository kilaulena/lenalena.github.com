            <p><a href="http://comatose.rubyforge.org/">Comatose</a> is a micro CMS, easy to embed in your Rails app, ideal when the customer wants to update her FAQ once in a while. I work on a few projects where comatose is integrated, and it's been the second time now that one specific problem has given headaches to me and my colleagues. Time to document the solution.</p><p>Comatose has a hierarchical structure. All the pages are children of the comatose root page, which is usually not in use. This root page is created by the migration AddComatoseSupport. When we add comatose to a project, we usually create another migration, where some child pages are created and populated (because the customer usually already knows what pages she wants). This can look like this:</p><p><a href="/2009-10-27-comatose-bug-when-creating-pages-in-migrations">Continue reading...</a></p>

            <p>Do you know what's behind these buzzwords — <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> / <a href="http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp">Couchapp</a> / <a href="http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/">Sammy.js</a>? Not really? Then please look at this article now — <a href="http://www.quirkey.com/blog/2009/09/15/sammy-js-couchdb-and-the-new-web-architecture">Sammy.js, CouchDB, and the new web architecture</a>. The title says it all.</p><p>This setup happens to be the field of my diploma thesis, friendly sponsored and supported by <a href="http://upstream-berlin.com">Upstream</a>. During the next months I'll develop a super duper thing with these technologies, and then I'll write 80 scientific pages about it. Yees, I'm not that much looking forward to the second part! Until then, I'm planning to semi-regularly blog about my findings.</p><p>I'm not allowed to share the code before I have the diploma in my hands. But, because my workmate <a href="http://twitter.com/bionadeholunder">Frank Proessdorf</a> is so jealous of what I do, he and I started working on an app with a similar setup on our Upstream Research Fridays, to try things out. <a href="http://github.com/lenalena/jsdoodle">Here it is</a>. Don't expect anything yet.</p><p>Today I'm going to tell you about some details of my testing setup.</p><p><a href="/2009-11-04-couchapp-culerity-glitches-part-1">Continue reading...</a></p>
