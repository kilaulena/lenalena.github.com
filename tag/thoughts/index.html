            <p>I'm done!! Three weeks ago <a href="http://blog.couch.io/post/903223195/diplom-thesis-realisation-of-a-distributed-application">I handed in my diplom thesis</a>. The practical part was the design and implementation of a distributed, replicatable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner">outliner</a> with the NoSQL database <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>. As theoretical work I evaluated Distributed Systems, CouchDB, various web technologies and programming strategies. I still have to pass the oral exam, but my degree is finally very close - soon I can call myself a graduated computer scientist. Yay!</p><p>As soon as academic procedures allow it, I'll publish the text and the source code of the thesis here. Until then I'd like to say thank you to a few people. As the foreword of thesis won't get as much attention as this blog, I'll do it here.</p><p><a href="/2010-08-05-thesis-is-done-thanks-for-your-support">Continue reading...</a></p>
