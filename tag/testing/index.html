            <p>Doing client work for <a href="http://upstream-agile.com">Upstream</a>, I recently had the pleasure of pair programming with fabulous <a href="http://freelancing-gods.com">Pat Allan</a> for a month.

Next to improved concentration, keeping each other from getting stuck in stuff, I like the sharing of best practices, Textmate short cuts, syntax tricks etc.</li><li>Instead of writing "puts" in, after and before blocks that don't act as expected, use ruby-debug.

            <p>In every project I use cucumber (that means, always) there are a few things that I keep reinventing, or I spend a lot of time searching for them in other projects. Here are some of them. They aren't all written by me, but maybe my coworkers like to use this as a reference, too?</p><p>When you upgrade to the current cucumber (0.4.2) from an older version some steps will fail, because cucumber doesn't examine the whole html anymore. You can still check the raw html with these steps:</p><p><a href="/2009-10-25-snippets-for-cucumber">Continue reading...</a></p>

            <p>Do you know what's behind these buzzwords — <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> / <a href="http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp">Couchapp</a> / <a href="http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/">Sammy.js</a>? Not really? Then please look at this article now — <a href="http://www.quirkey.com/blog/2009/09/15/sammy-js-couchdb-and-the-new-web-architecture">Sammy.js, CouchDB, and the new web architecture</a>. The title says it all.</p><p>This setup happens to be the field of my diploma thesis, friendly sponsored and supported by <a href="http://upstream-berlin.com">Upstream</a>. During the next months I'll develop a super duper thing with these technologies, and then I'll write 80 scientific pages about it. Yees, I'm not that much looking forward to the second part! Until then, I'm planning to semi-regularly blog about my findings.</p><p>I'm not allowed to share the code before I have the diploma in my hands. But, because my workmate <a href="http://twitter.com/bionadeholunder">Frank Proessdorf</a> is so jealous of what I do, he and I started working on an app with a similar setup on our Upstream Research Fridays, to try things out. <a href="http://github.com/lenalena/jsdoodle">Here it is</a>. Don't expect anything yet.</p><p>Today I'm going to tell you about some details of my testing setup.</p><p><a href="/2009-11-04-couchapp-culerity-glitches-part-1">Continue reading...</a></p>
