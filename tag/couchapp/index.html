            <p>If you have a couchapp and want to have nice URLS, go <a href="http://blog.couchone.com/post/443028592/whats-new-in-apache-couchdb-0-11-part-one-nice-urls">read this blogpost</a>. If you still don't get it, here is how to do it. It doesn't work with my outliner app, because it is so entangled with old couchapp and jquery.couch.js versions and I'm not up to upgrade hell right now. But I'll write it down for my next project and for you, yay.</p><p>Let's say you have an app running at http://account.couchone.com/mydb/_design/doingnotes/index.html and want to add the additional URL http://account.couchone.com/index.html. First you have to set up a virtual host. (Want to know why? Go back <a href="http://blog.couchone.com/post/443028592/whats-new-in-apache-couchdb-0-11-part-one-nice-urls">read the blogpost</a>).

            <p>I'm happy to announce the immediate availability of my thesis! It was handed in in July 2010 as my diplom thesis in the academic program of Media Informatics at <a href="http://www.beuth-hochschule.de/">Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin</a> (University of Applied Sciences). A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom">German Diplom</a> is comparable to a combined bachelor's and master's degree. Originally it has been written in German, so I'm very happy it's also available for English speaking readers now — thanks a lot to the awesome <a title="Copywriting, Translation" href="http://www.sanderstruck.com/">Sander Van de Moortel</a> for translating it into English, and to <a href="http://blog.couchone.com/post/1415269773/im-happy-to-announce-the-immediate-availability">CouchOne</a> for sponsoring the translation. Read also <a href="http://lenaherrmann.net/2010/08/05/thesis-is-done-thanks-for-your-support">my thank you notes</a> for more gratefulness.</p><p>I hope the thesis is an interesting read and useful for your research or development!</p><p><a href="/2010/10/27/ta-da-here-is-my-thesis">Continue reading...</a></p>
