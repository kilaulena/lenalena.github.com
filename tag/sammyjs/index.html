            <p>I'm happy to announce the immediate availability of my thesis! It was handed in in July 2010 as my diplom thesis in the academic program of Media Informatics at <a href="http://www.beuth-hochschule.de/">Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin</a> (University of Applied Sciences). A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom">German Diplom</a> is comparable to a combined bachelor's and master's degree. Originally it has been written in German, so I'm very happy it's also available for English speaking readers now — thanks a lot to the awesome <a title="Copywriting, Translation" href="http://www.sanderstruck.com/">Sander Van de Moortel</a> for translating it into English, and to <a href="http://blog.couchone.com/post/1415269773/im-happy-to-announce-the-immediate-availability">CouchOne</a> for sponsoring the translation. Read also <a href="http://lenaherrmann.net/2010/08/05/thesis-is-done-thanks-for-your-support">my thank you notes</a> for more gratefulness.</p><p>I hope the thesis is an interesting read and useful for your research or development!</p><p><a href="/2010/10/27/ta-da-here-is-my-thesis">Continue reading...</a></p>
