            <p>I'm currently writing my thesis, using <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. As the programming part of my thesis was mostly done in Javascript, I have to include some bits of Javascript source code in the LaTeX document. For this I'm using the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Packages/Listings">listings package</a>. With this package you can "include the source code of any programming language within your document". Unfortunately Javascript is not in the list of supported programming languages. (In return, the list contains languages like Oberon-2, Promela or RSL, which are probably being used way more often than Javascript ... er.)</p><p>Luckily <a href="http://twitter.com/awendt">@awendt</a> pointed me to these links — <a href="http://vis4.net/blog/2009/08/javascript-quelltexte-in-latex/">Javascript Quelltexte in LaTeX</a> and <a href="http://mail.asta.uni-potsdam.de/pipermail/uplug/2006-June/003595.html">a thread on a mailinglist</a>. I changed those examples only a bit, I'm posting my result here mainly in the hope it will produce a Google hit for "javascript latex source code" :-)</p><p><a href="/2010-05-20-javascript-syntax-highlighting-in-the-latex-listings-package">Continue reading...</a></p>

            <p>I'm happy to announce the immediate availability of my thesis! It was handed in in July 2010 as my diplom thesis in the academic program of Media Informatics at <a href="http://www.beuth-hochschule.de/">Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin</a> (University of Applied Sciences). A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom">German Diplom</a> is comparable to a combined bachelor's and master's degree. Originally it has been written in German, so I'm very happy it's also available for English speaking readers now — thanks a lot to the awesome <a title="Copywriting, Translation" href="http://www.sanderstruck.com/">Sander Van de Moortel</a> for translating it into English, and to <a href="http://blog.couchone.com/post/1415269773/im-happy-to-announce-the-immediate-availability">CouchOne</a> for sponsoring the translation. Read also <a href="http://lenaherrmann.net/2010/08/05/thesis-is-done-thanks-for-your-support">my thank you notes</a> for more gratefulness.</p><p>I hope the thesis is an interesting read and useful for your research or development!</p><p><a href="/2010/10/27/ta-da-here-is-my-thesis">Continue reading...</a></p>
