            <p>Do you know what's behind these buzzwords — <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> / <a href="http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp">Couchapp</a> / <a href="http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/">Sammy.js</a>? Not really? Then please look at this article now — <a href="http://www.quirkey.com/blog/2009/09/15/sammy-js-couchdb-and-the-new-web-architecture">Sammy.js, CouchDB, and the new web architecture</a>. The title says it all.</p><p>This setup happens to be the field of my diploma thesis, friendly sponsored and supported by <a href="http://upstream-berlin.com">Upstream</a>. During the next months I'll develop a super duper thing with these technologies, and then I'll write 80 scientific pages about it. Yees, I'm not that much looking forward to the second part! Until then, I'm planning to semi-regularly blog about my findings.</p><p>I'm not allowed to share the code before I have the diploma in my hands. But, because my workmate <a href="http://twitter.com/bionadeholunder">Frank Proessdorf</a> is so jealous of what I do, he and I started working on an app with a similar setup on our Upstream Research Fridays, to try things out. <a href="http://github.com/lenalena/jsdoodle">Here it is</a>. Don't expect anything yet.</p><p>Today I'm going to tell you about some details of my testing setup.</p><p><a href="/2009-11-04-couchapp-culerity-glitches-part-1">Continue reading...</a></p>

            <p>I'm currently writing my thesis, using <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. As the programming part of my thesis was mostly done in Javascript, I have to include some bits of Javascript source code in the LaTeX document. For this I'm using the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Packages/Listings">listings package</a>. With this package you can "include the source code of any programming language within your document". Unfortunately Javascript is not in the list of supported programming languages. (In return, the list contains languages like Oberon-2, Promela or RSL, which are probably being used way more often than Javascript ... er.)</p><p>Luckily <a href="http://twitter.com/awendt">@awendt</a> pointed me to these links — <a href="http://vis4.net/blog/2009/08/javascript-quelltexte-in-latex/">Javascript Quelltexte in LaTeX</a> and <a href="http://mail.asta.uni-potsdam.de/pipermail/uplug/2006-June/003595.html">a thread on a mailinglist</a>. I changed those examples only a bit, I'm posting my result here mainly in the hope it will produce a Google hit for "javascript latex source code" :-)</p><p><a href="/2010-05-20-javascript-syntax-highlighting-in-the-latex-listings-package">Continue reading...</a></p>

            <p>I'm happy to announce the immediate availability of my thesis! It was handed in in July 2010 as my diplom thesis in the academic program of Media Informatics at <a href="http://www.beuth-hochschule.de/">Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin</a> (University of Applied Sciences). A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom">German Diplom</a> is comparable to a combined bachelor's and master's degree. Originally it has been written in German, so I'm very happy it's also available for English speaking readers now — thanks a lot to the awesome <a title="Copywriting, Translation" href="http://www.sanderstruck.com/">Sander Van de Moortel</a> for translating it into English, and to <a href="http://blog.couchone.com/post/1415269773/im-happy-to-announce-the-immediate-availability">CouchOne</a> for sponsoring the translation. Read also <a href="http://lenaherrmann.net/2010/08/05/thesis-is-done-thanks-for-your-support">my thank you notes</a> for more gratefulness.</p><p>I hope the thesis is an interesting read and useful for your research or development!</p><p><a href="/2010/10/27/ta-da-here-is-my-thesis">Continue reading...</a></p>
