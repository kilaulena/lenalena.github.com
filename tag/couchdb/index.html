            <p>Do you know what's behind these buzzwords — <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> / <a href="http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp">Couchapp</a> / <a href="http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/">Sammy.js</a>? Not really? Then please look at this article now — <a href="http://www.quirkey.com/blog/2009/09/15/sammy-js-couchdb-and-the-new-web-architecture">Sammy.js, CouchDB, and the new web architecture</a>. The title says it all.</p><p>This setup happens to be the field of my diploma thesis, friendly sponsored and supported by <a href="http://upstream-berlin.com">Upstream</a>. During the next months I'll develop a super duper thing with these technologies, and then I'll write 80 scientific pages about it. Yees, I'm not that much looking forward to the second part! Until then, I'm planning to semi-regularly blog about my findings.</p><p>I'm not allowed to share the code before I have the diploma in my hands. But, because my workmate <a href="http://twitter.com/bionadeholunder">Frank Proessdorf</a> is so jealous of what I do, he and I started working on an app with a similar setup on our Upstream Research Fridays, to try things out. <a href="http://github.com/lenalena/jsdoodle">Here it is</a>. Don't expect anything yet.</p><p>Today I'm going to tell you about some details of my testing setup.</p><p><a href="/2009-11-04-couchapp-culerity-glitches-part-1">Continue reading...</a></p>

            <p>I'm done!! Three weeks ago <a href="http://blog.couch.io/post/903223195/diplom-thesis-realisation-of-a-distributed-application">I handed in my diplom thesis</a>. The practical part was the design and implementation of a distributed, replicatable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner">outliner</a> with the NoSQL database <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>. As theoretical work I evaluated Distributed Systems, CouchDB, various web technologies and programming strategies. I still have to pass the oral exam, but my degree is finally very close - soon I can call myself a graduated computer scientist. Yay!</p><p>As soon as academic procedures allow it, I'll publish the text and the source code of the thesis here. Until then I'd like to say thank you to a few people. As the foreword of thesis won't get as much attention as this blog, I'll do it here.</p><p><a href="/2010-08-05-thesis-is-done-thanks-for-your-support">Continue reading...</a></p>

            <p>If you have a couchapp and want to have nice URLS, go <a href="http://blog.couchone.com/post/443028592/whats-new-in-apache-couchdb-0-11-part-one-nice-urls">read this blogpost</a>. If you still don't get it, here is how to do it. It doesn't work with my outliner app, because it is so entangled with old couchapp and jquery.couch.js versions and I'm not up to upgrade hell right now. But I'll write it down for my next project and for you, yay.</p><p>Let's say you have an app running at http://account.couchone.com/mydb/_design/doingnotes/index.html and want to add the additional URL http://account.couchone.com/index.html. First you have to set up a virtual host. (Want to know why? Go back <a href="http://blog.couchone.com/post/443028592/whats-new-in-apache-couchdb-0-11-part-one-nice-urls">read the blogpost</a>). If you are using a hosted CouchDB instance and don't have access to the local.ini file, you can also do this remotely:</p><p><a href="/2010/10/27/ta-da-here-is-my-thesis">Continue reading...</a></p>

            <p>I'm happy to announce the immediate availability of my thesis! It was handed in in July 2010 as my diplom thesis in the academic program of Media Informatics at <a href="http://www.beuth-hochschule.de/">Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin</a> (University of Applied Sciences). A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom">German Diplom</a> is comparable to a combined bachelor's and master's degree. Originally it has been written in German, so I'm very happy it's also available for English speaking readers now — thanks a lot to the awesome <a title="Copywriting, Translation" href="http://www.sanderstruck.com/">Sander Van de Moortel</a> for translating it into English, and to <a href="http://blog.couchone.com/post/1415269773/im-happy-to-announce-the-immediate-availability">CouchOne</a> for sponsoring the translation. Read also <a href="http://lenaherrmann.net/2010/08/05/thesis-is-done-thanks-for-your-support">my thank you notes</a> for more gratefulness.</p><p>I hope the thesis is an interesting read and useful for your research or development!</p><p><a href="/2010/10/27/ta-da-here-is-my-thesis">Continue reading...</a></p>
